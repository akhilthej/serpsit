                    <p>Enterprise data recovery is the process of restoring lost, corrupted, accidentally deleted, or otherwise inaccessible data to its server, computer, mobile device, or storage device (or to a new device if the original device no longer works).

Typically, the data is restored from a backup copy that is stored in another location. The more recent the backup copy, the more completely the data can be recovered in the event of loss or damage. For any business, successful data recovery—data recovery that prevents a greater-than-tolerable loss of data or discontinuity of business due to loss of data—requires the business to have a backup and restore plan that meets specific data recovery objectives, usually as part of a larger disaster recovery plan.</p>
